.

was it always like this ambling down queen st with triple sec and gravy and twostep in my veins a girl asking  
how i know and can i please pay you back while i ask how did you really find your internship at the embassy

the stocks swing like tortured prisoners and i chuckle nervously at forecasts of economies past and present  
_you should have wagered more on barrick and less on these shmucks _is what confucius would say

picking out groceries has never been this fun as i rummage through a pile of apples oh the shine and crisp  
the cashier smiles at my collection of gastronomic oddities and i at the kids pocketing discount chocolate

i almost get the impression of a scripted sale _we prefer the church of latter day saints _please relieve me  
this burden of uncertainty i used to be just like you and his friend says the same thing _oh god please help_

i've been meaning to catch up really i was away to shanghai huangshan taiwan phoenix pittsburgh and home  
so let's realize how funny it is when everything changes and doesn't _please ha ha really please laugh with me_

we sit on monkey bars after wandering through another graveyard clutch hands promising next time  
we will climb the construction crane and find beauty in the murmur of four-cylinder hearts going down

her hand in my pocket just like my dad used to say and i look at the stitches on his brow and tell my mom  
which pills to take and she calls me at work to say i love you and feels this distance of endless parenthood

the corporation has finally contacted me to be their middleman and i celebrate in song veiled as capital  
purchase books and listen to pop in traffic and raise a glass to this unpredictable jumble of quanta we call life

to realize the chatter of rain and the cough of thunder then the supreme pleasure to dream and wake  
to the warmth of wordless happiness _oh oh oh_
